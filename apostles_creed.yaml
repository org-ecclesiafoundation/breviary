    What does this mean?

    I believe that God has made me and all creatures; that He has given me my
    body and soul, eyes, ears, and all my members, my reason and all my senses,
    and still takes care of them.

    He also gives me clothing and shoes, food and drink, house and home, wife
    and children, land, animals, and all I have. He richly and daily provides me
    with all that I need to support this body and life.

    He defends me against all danger and guards and protects me from all evil.

    All this He does only out of fatherly, divine goodness and mercy, without
    any merit or worthiness in me. For all this it is my duty to thank and
    praise, serve and obey Him.

    This is most certainly true.

    What does this mean?

    I believe that Jesus Christ, true God, begotten of the Father from eternity,
    and also true man, born of the Virgin Mary, is my Lord.

    who has redeemed me, a lost and condemned person, purchased and wone me from
    all sins, from death, and from the power of the devil; not with gold or
    silver, but with His holy, precious blood and with with His innocent
    suffering and death,

    that I may be His own and live under Him in His kingdom and serve Him in
    everlasting righteousness, innocence, and blessedness, just as He is risen
    from the dead, lives and reigns to all eternity.

    This is most certainly true.

  explanation: >
    What does this mean?

    I believe that I cannot by my own reason or strength believe in Jesus Christ,
    my Lord, or come to Him; but the Holy Spirit has called me by the Gospel,
    enlightened me with His gifts, sanctified and kept me in the true faith.

    In the same way He calls, gathers, enlightens, and sanctifies the whole
    Christian church on earth, and keeps it with Jesus Christ in the one true
    faith.

    In this Christian church He daily and richly forgives all my sins and the
    sins of all believers.

    On the Last Day He will raise me and all the dead, and give eterna life to me
    and all believers in Christ.

    This is most certainly true.
